Study Case: Report from Richard (Sales Manager)
-	We need to improve the online sales reports and want to move from static reports to visual dashboards.
-	We want to focus it on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been overtime.
-	Seeing as each salesperson works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also.
-	We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance.
-	The budget is for 2021 and we usually look 2 year back in time when we do analysis of sales.
